# Overview
Challenge: Build a full stack quiz game.

Solution: The web application was built with a front-end framework (Reactjs), a back-end Django RESTful API and some additional libraries for styling (Materialize &  Font Awesome).

# Technical choices and Tradeoffs
### Choices
I am currently teaching myself Reactjs and have experimented with the Django Rest Framework so saw it as a good opportunity to improve skills in both these technologies.

### Tradeoffs
+ Would have liked to:
    - Store the leaderboard in Django
    - Have topics so users can choose type of questions
    - Add a countdown to limit time spent on questions
    - Do some unit and integration testing
